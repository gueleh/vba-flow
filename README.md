## Introduction

This repository contains a library of solutions based on Excel VBA.

It is being built gradually.

Unless otherwise specified, each solution is contained in a separate folder.

These solutions either work independently or are based on Flow Framework 2, please refer to https://github.com/gueleh/flowframework2 to learn more about this framework.

Unless otherwise specified, you can use these solutions freely as long as you do not use them commercially. In case of commercial usage please contact me and we'll reach an agreement for your usage.

## Solutions

### Basic Semi-Automated Testing
With this small solution you can easily write and run tests when working with Excel VBA. It is not a test suite, it is not fully automated, but it is small and easy to use, with the potential to add a lot of value to your development experience. You can find this solution in the subfolder [basic-semi-automated-testing.](https://github.com/gueleh/vba-flow/tree/main/basic-semi-automated-testing)https://github.com/gueleh/vba-flow/tree/main/basic-semi-automated-testing.
