# vba-flow

## Introduction

VBA.Flow() is the name of my way of working with Excel VBA, an approach that evolved over many years. You can learn more about this here: https://vba-flow.net/.

This repository contains a library of solutions based on Excel VBA.

It is being built gradually.

Unless otherwise specified, each solution is contained in a separate folder.

These solutions either work independently or are based on Flow Framework 2, please refer to https://github.com/gueleh/flowframework2 to learn more about this framework.

Unless otherwise specified, you can use these solutions freely as long as you do not use them commercially. In case of commercial usage please contact me and we'll reach an agreement for your usage.

## Solutions

### Basic Semi-Automated Testing
With this small solution you can easily write and run tests when working with Excel VBA. It is not a test suite, it is not fully automated, but it is small and easy to use, with the potential to add a lot of value to your development experience. You can find this solution in the subfolder https://github.com/gueleh/vba-flow/tree/main/basic-semi-automated-testing.

### User Defined Functions
A package with some user defined functions, i.e. functions that can be used in cells. Also includes a class for registering a user defined function in the function wizard of Excel and applies this to the functions of the package. You can find this solution in the subfolder https://github.com/gueleh/vba-flow/tree/main/user-defined-functions.

### Version Control Data Generator
With this solution you can easily generate files for using version control with Excel. This includes the code modules, but also other important data like named ranges, worksheet meta data, defined worksheet contents and contents of settings sheets, the two worksheet-related bits by contract, i.e. the structure must meet certain criteria. You can find this solution in the subfolder https://github.com/gueleh/vba-flow/tree/main/version-control-data-generator.
